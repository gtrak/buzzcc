HW #1 - Grigory Trakhman

I did this entirely in Python with the PLY module.  You don't need to install it as i have
included it in a subdirectory, just run 'python luac.py $yourtestcase'

The top half of the program is the lexer module, and the bottom is the parser.  I did not 
complete a proper class-based AST, but instead just have a parse tree where i've removed 
commas and quotation marks.  The grammar rules are evaluated by the yacc module based on 
reflection.  Yacc.py parses the docstrings for the rules and creates parse tables.

I implemented the grammar according to the homework spec, and I also did Comments and 
attempted multi-line strings (they're commented out at the moment) according to the 
lua 5.1 spec.  There are a couple of test cases demonstrating strings and comments.
